The committee may also determine whether a limit should be imposed on the number of banks or on the percentage of District deposits controlled by a single company; whether specific capitalization, employment, and location requirements should be imposed on out-of-state bank holding companies wishing to acquire District banks or bank holding companies; and whether specific plans detailing how the acquiror and acquiree intend to serve deposit and credit needs of District residents should be required. As soon as practicable after conclusion of the hearing, but no later than 6 months after the hearing, the committee shall file with the Office of the Secretary a recommendation or recommendations for Council action to alter the provisions of this subchapter, if necessary.</text>

        <text>Because of the codification of D.C. Law 11-142 as subchapter II of Chapter 8 [subchapter II of Chapter 7, 2001 Ed.], and the designation of the preexisting text as subchapter I, "subchapter" has been substituted for "chapter" in the introductory language of (a) and in (b).</text>
