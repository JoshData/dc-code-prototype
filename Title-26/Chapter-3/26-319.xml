        <text>"(2) A personal check for deferred deposit must bear an issue date of not later than the date the check is cashed and the deferred deposit agreement is originated.</text>
        <text>"(3) The deposit date of a check held for deferred deposit shall not exceed 31 days following the issue date of the check as agreed to in the Deferred Deposit Disclosure Agreement, Addendum I; provided, however, that when the deposit date occurs on a weekend or bank holiday, the check may be deposited on the next business day.</text>
