To the extent permitted by federal law and regulation, the determination of each LEC's share and Voice Over Internet Protocol Service provider's share shall be in proportion to each LEC's and Voice Over Internet Protocol Service provider's total revenues for local telecommunications or telecommunications services derived from end users in the District during the previous year.</text>
