        <text>D.C. Law 14-282 repealed subsec. (d); and added subsec. (e). Prior to repeal, subsec. (d) had read as follows:</text>
        <text>"(d)(1)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the deduction of a qualified conservation contribution as claimed under section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 approved August 16, 1954 (68A Stat. 58; 26 U.S.C. § 170)('section 170'), shall be allowed under § 47-1803.03, notwithstanding the nonenforceability of the recorded instrument, the nonperpetual nature of the restriction, and the actual value of the contribution if the claimed value does not exceed 15% of the fair market value of the real property.</text>
        <text>"(B) If the deduction is disallowed for federal income tax purposes, the deduction shall be disallowed under § 47-1803.03(b).</text>
        <text>"(C) This paragraph shall apply to all instruments recorded at the Recorder of Deeds prior to October 1, 2002.</text>
        <text>"(2)(A) The restriction (granted in perpetuity) of a qualified real property interest, as defined in section 170, shall further require the unqualified subordination of all mortgage and deed of trust interests in the real property, including the express subordination of such interests to a lien resulting from enforcement of the instrument that created the qualified conservation contribution. Subject to subparagraph (E) of this paragraph, the following language shall provide prima facie evidence of compliance with the requirement that the enforcement lien shall be superior in priority to any such interests:</text>
        <text>"In the event of a violation of this easement, the grantee shall have, and the grantor, and mortgagee or trustee of the deed of trust, present or future, hereby grant to grantee, the following rights:</text>
        <text>" '(a) The right to institute legal proceedings to enjoin such violation by ex parte, temporary, and permanent injunction, to require the restoration of the real property, including the facade, to its prior condition, to collect money damages, to be reimbursed for all costs and attorneys' fees, and to avail itself of all other legal and equitable remedies;</text>
        <text>" '(b) The right to enter upon the land and into the improvement of the real property in order to correct such violation and hold grantor and the real property responsible for the cost thereof; and</text>
        <text>" '(c) The right to seek to place a lien against the real property to secure the payment of any of the obligations arising under this instrument, and such lien shall enjoy the same priority as this instrument regardless of whether such lien was foreseeable.'</text>
        <text>"(B) The assent to the terms of the instrument of the grantor, and mortgagee or trustee of a deed of trust, or their respective duly appointed and recorded attorneys, in fact, shall be expressly stated and acknowledged according to law.</text>
        <text>"(C) The instrument, and any return required by the Recorder of Deeds, shall specifically recite the value of the qualified conservation contribution and any cost and donation incurred by the grantor thereof.</text>
        <text>"(D) No deduction shall be allowed for a qualified conservation contribution that does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.</text>
        <text>"(E) If the deduction is disallowed for federal income tax purposes, the deduction shall be disallowed under § 47-1803.03(a).</text>
        <text>"(F) This paragraph shall apply to all instruments recorded at the Recorder of Deeds on or after October 1, 2002."</text>
