        <text>"(a) The Board of Education ("Board") shall adopt uniform disciplinary standards:</text>
        <text>"(1) To determine when class exclusions will be the appropriate disciplinary measure for students;</text>
        <text>"(2) To promote the education of students in the school, except for those students who may be a danger to the school's faculty, students, or others, where the student was placed prior to disciplinary action, and that prioritize consideration of the student's academic standing, the educational needs of the students, and the number of previous offenses.</text>
        <text>"(b) The standards adopted under subsection (a) of this section shall include a progressive schedule of discipline which promotes the goal of in-class education for students subject to disciplinary action, beginning with in-class intervention strategies and ending with expulsion as the final and most extreme form of discipline, and to the extent consistent with this progressive schedule, it shall be the policy of the District of Columbia to prefer in-school disciplinary action, except for those students who may be a danger to the school's faculty, students, or others.</text>
        <text>"(c) The Board shall require a monthly report of disciplinary measures taken by each school regarding class exclusions and suspensions, including the rationale for the particular choice of discipline.</text>
        <text>"(d) The Mayor shall provide for comprehensive inter-agency collaborative support programs, such as programs offered by the Department of Mental Health, the Department of Human Services, the Child and Family Services Agency, and the Department of Parks and Recreation, to assist the student subject to class exclusion at the school, except for those students who may be a danger to the school's faculty, students, or others, where the student was placed prior to the disciplinary action.</text>
        <text>"(e) The Mayor shall make resources available to support the programs in subsection (d) of this section within the context of appropriated funds within the budget and financial plan."</text>
        <text>Section 4(b) of D.C. Law 17-8 provides that the act shall expire after 225 days of its having taken effect.</text>
