      <num>(1)</num>
      <text>In Fiscal Year 2006, the District of Columbia Public Schools ("DCPS") will receive a core budget of $779,309,000 with additional funding in the amount of $21 million for the Superintendent's school reform initiatives.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(2)</num>
      <text>Despite an overall increase in funding for DCPS, local schools have been forced to develop plans to reduce their workforces because the 3.07% increase in the uniform per student funding formula does not cover the average step increase of 4.77% included in collective bargaining agreements approved by the Mayor and Council.</text>

      <text>The Council believes that these reductions, which would come one year following the elimination of 500 school-based positions, are unacceptable and, if implemented, would be injurious to the DCPS.</text>

      <text>As a result, there is a need to avert layoffs of more than 300 staff at individual schools.</text>

      <text>DCPS should absorb the cost of the step increases from non-local school budget funds.</text>
