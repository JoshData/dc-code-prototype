  <level>
    <num>(a)</num>
    <text>The accordance and delineation of clinical privileges shall be determined on an individual basis and commensurate with an applicant's education, training, experience, and demonstrated current competence. In implementing these criteria, each facility and agency shall formulate and apply reasonable, nondiscriminatory standards for the evaluation of an applicant's credentials. As part of its overall responsibility for the operation of a facility or agency, the governing body, or designated persons so functioning, shall ensure that decisions on clinical privileges and staff membership are based on an objective evaluation of an applicant's credentials, free of anticompetitive intent or purpose. Whenever possible, the credentials committee and other staff who evaluate and determine the qualifications of applicants for clinical privileges and staff membership shall include members of the applicant's profession. The credentials committee shall accept the District of Columbia's uniform credentialing form as the sole application for a healthcare provider to become credentialed or recredentialed.</text>
