      <text>D.C. Law 15-187 rewrote subsec. (d) which had read as follows: "(d) A voluntary agreement shall run for the term of a license, including renewal periods, unless it is terminated or amended in writing by the parties and the termination or amendment is approved by the Board."</text>
      <text>The 2013 amendment by D.C. Law 19-310 rewrote the section heading, which read: "Voluntary agreements; approval process, show cause hearing for violation"; substituted "settlement agreement" for "voluntary agreement" throughout the section; redesignated (b) as (b)(1) and added (b)(2) and (b)(3); and rewrote (e), which read: "The Board shall initiate a show cause hearing upon evidence that a licensee has violated a voluntary agreement. Upon a determination that the licensee has violated the voluntary agreement, the Board shall penalize the licensee according to the provisions set forth for violations of a license in Chapter 8."</text>
