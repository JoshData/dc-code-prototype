    <text>On application by a judgment creditor of a member or transferee, a court may enter a charging order against the financial rights of the judgment debtor for the unsatisfied amount of the judgment. A charging order issued under this subsection shall constitute a lien on the judgment debtor's financial rights and require the limited cooperative association to pay over to the creditor or receiver, to the extent necessary to satisfy the judgment, any distribution that would otherwise be paid to the judgment debtor.</text>
  </level>

    <num>(b)</num>
    <text>To the extent necessary to effectuate the collection of distributions pursuant to a charging order under subsection (a) of this section, the court may:</text>

The purchaser at the foreclosure sale shall obtain only the financial rights that are subject to the charging order, shall not thereby become a member, and shall be subject to § 29-1006.03.</text>

Unless the organic rules otherwise provide, the association shall act under this subsection only with the consent of all members whose financial rights are not subject to the charging order.</text>
