      <text>D.C. Law 16-306 rewrote the section, which had previously read:</text>
      <text>"Any person who, for purposes of prostitution, persuades, entices, or forcibly abducts a child under 16 years of age from his or her home or usual abode, or from the custody and control of the child's parents or guardian, shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than 2 years and not more than 20 years; and whoever knowingly secretes or harbors any child so persuaded, enticed, or abducted shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than 8 years."</text>
      <text>The 2013 amendment by D.C. Law 19-317 substituted "not more than the amount set forth in § 22-3571.01" for "not more than $20,000" in (b).</text>
