        <text>D.C. Law 17-388 substituted "firearm" for "pistol"; substituted "10 days" for "48 hours"; and substituted "shall be transported in accordance with § 22- 4504.02" for "shall be securely wrapped and shall be unloaded".</text>
        <text>D.C. Law 19-170 rewrote the section, which formerly read:</text>

The seller shall, within 6 hours after such application, sign and attach his or her address and deliver 1 copy to such person or persons as the Chief of Police of the District of Columbia may designate, and shall retain the other copy for 6 years. No machine gun, sawed-off shotgun, or blackjack shall be sold to any person other than the persons designated in § 22-4514 as entitled to possess the same, and then only after permission to make such sale has been obtained from the Chief of Police of the District of Columbia.
