        <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
        <text>D.C. Law 18-315 rewrote subsec. (a); and added subsecs. (c) and (d). Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) read as follows:</text>
        <text>"(a) The Mayor shall investigate from time to time the economic conditions and other factors relating to and affecting the business of making pawnbroker loans under this part, and shall ascertain all pertinent facts necessary to determine what maximum rate of interest should be permitted. Upon the basis of such ascertained facts, the Council of the District of Columbia shall determine and fix by regulation or order a maximum rate of interest in connection with such loans which will induce efficiently managed commercial capital to be invested in such business in sufficient amounts to make available adequate credit facilities to individuals seeking such loans at reasonable rates of interest, and which will afford those engaged in such business a fair and reasonable return upon the assets. The Council may from time to time, upon the basis of changed conditions or facts, redetermine and refix any such maximum rate of interest, but, before determining or redetermining any such maximum rate, the Council shall give reasonable notice of its intention to consider doing so to all licensees and a reasonable opportunity to be heard and introduce evidence with respect thereto, and such notice shall also be published once each week for 2 consecutive weeks in one or more of the daily newspapers published in the District. Any such changed maximum rate of interest shall not affect preexisting loan contracts lawfully entered into between any licensee and any borrower. Until such time as a different rate is fixed by the Council in accordance with the authorization contained in this section, every licensed pawnbroker may contract for and receive on any loan of money, not exceeding 2 per centum per month, or fraction thereof, upon any loan not exceeding the sum of $200, or more than 1 per centum per month or fraction thereof, upon any loan exceeding $200 and not exceeding $1,000, and 8 per centum per annum on any loan in excess of $1,000, under a penalty of $100 for each such offense; provided, that pawnbrokers may ask, demand, and receive a minimum charge in lieu of interest of $.50."</text>

        <heading>Change in Government</heading>
        <text>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 402(72) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to the District of Columbia Council, subject to the right of the Commissioner as provided in § 406 of the Plan. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</text>
