    <text>The owner of real property subject to a special assessment under this subchapter may contest the amount of the special assessment (but not the authority to levy the special assessment) imposed on the real property by filing a written notice of appeal with the Chief Financial Officer not later than 60 days after the due date of the payment of the special assessment. The Chief Financial Officer shall promptly review the appeal and, if necessary, meet with the owner of the real property, consider written and oral evidence regarding the amount of the special assessment, and decide the appeal. If the result of the appeal requires the special assessment to be adjusted in favor of the owner of the real property, a cash refund shall not be made (except in the last year of the contribution period), but an adjustment shall be made to the next special assessment to be collected from that real property. No interest on the adjustment shall be due to the owner of the real property. This procedure shall be exclusive and its exhaustion by an owner shall be a condition precedent to any other appeal or legal action by the owner.</text>
