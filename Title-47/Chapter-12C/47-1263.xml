      <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
      <text>D.C. Law 16-33, rewrote subsec. (b) and added subsec. (e). Prior to amendment, subsec. (b) read as follows: "(b) Except for fiscal Year 2005, the Mayor shall provide notice to each nursing facility of the amount of the assessment for the ensuing fiscal year no later than September 1." Law 16-191 validated a previously made change in the designation of subsec. (e).</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 17-219, in the lead-in language, inserted "up to" preceding "6%"; and rewrote par. (2), which had read as follows: "(2) For fiscal year 2006 and each succeeding fiscal year, the Mayor shall determine the uniform amount per licensed bed that will equal 6% per annum of net resident revenue by rules issued pursuant to § 47-1267.</text>
