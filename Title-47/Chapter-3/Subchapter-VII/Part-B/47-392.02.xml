      <text>"(b) The criteria for spending from this Reserve are to ensure budget balance in case of a shortfall in revenue, or to provide flexibility to fund such expenditures as nonrecurring initiatives that support sustainable and measurable increases in revenues through enhanced service delivery, that reduce costs, that are unforeseen demands on District spending, or that constitute an investment in fostering the District's economic well-being. The District shall spend the funds from the Reserve in such a way that an appropriate balance is available in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quarters to ensure balance between revenues and expenditures at year end. Under no circumstances should the budgeted Reserve serve to provide resources to agencies to allow them to overspend their budget.</text>
      <text>"(c) In accordance with the criteria set forth in subsection (b) of this section, funds from the Reserve shall be applied in the following order:</text>
