(b)(2), substituted "recommending potential modifications to tax rates" for "enabling the possibility that general rates might be reduced"; and, in subsec.

(a)(1), (b)(6), and (d) read as follows:</text>
        <text>"(1) Mitigate the current tax burden on taxpayers;"</text>
        <text>"(6) To conduct an analysis of a split rate approach to real property taxation together with a recommendation as to how it could be structured with minimal effect on taxes paid by the average taxpayer."</text>
