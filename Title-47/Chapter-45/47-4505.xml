      <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
      <text>D.C. Law 14-307, in the section name line, inserted "and initial implementation" after "Administration"; rewrote subsec. (a); in subsec. (c), made a nonsubstantive change in par. (12), and added par. (12). Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) had read as follows: "(a) The Chief Financial Officer shall take such action as may be necessary to effectuate the Trust, issue regulations with respect to the Program, and in connection therewith, the Trust, and otherwise initiate the implementation and administration of the Program consistent with this chapter. The Chief Financial Officer shall continue to administer and maintain the Program in a manner to ensure that the Program continues to qualify as a qualified tuition program under section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986."</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 16-191, in subsec. (c)(12), validated a previously made technical correction.</text>
