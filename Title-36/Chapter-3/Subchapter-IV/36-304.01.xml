      <text>D.C. Law 13-130 rewrote this section, which previously read:</text>
      <text>"(a) For the purposes of this section, the term 'full service retail service station' means any retail service station location which provides a garage, service bay, work area, or similar enclosed area for repairing, maintaining, servicing, or otherwise working on motor vehicles, or any service islands. Such repair, maintenance, and service work may include, but is not limited to, the installation or replacement of batteries, tires, fan belts, lights, brakes, water pumps, mufflers and other parts and accessories and the performance of motor oil changes, lubrications, wheel alignments, tune-ups, tire repairs, brake adjustments, and general repair and maintenance work and services.</text>
      <text>"(b) No retail service station which is operated as a full service retail service station on or after April 19, 1977, may be structurally altered, modified, or otherwise converted, irrespective of the type or magnitude of the alteration, modification, or conversion, including, but not limited to, any alteration, modification, or conversion which has the effect of merely obstructing access to an existing garage, service bay, work area, or similar enclosed area by any motor vehicle which was previously accommodated, into a non-full service facility until October 1, 1999.</text>
      <text>"(c) No person who is an operator of any full service retail service station on or after April 19, 1977, including any person who is a subsequent operator of any such retail service station, or who, in any manner, controls the operation of any such retail service station, shall substantially reduce the number, types, quantity, or quality of the repair, maintenance, and other services, including the retail sale of motor fuels, petroleum products, and automotive products, previously offered until October 1, 1999. Such operators shall maintain the retail service station's existing garages, service bays, work areas, and similar areas in a fully operational condition and reasonably equipped to perform repair, maintenance, and service work on motor vehicles, including the provision of a qualified individual or individuals who is or are capable of performing repair, maintenance, and service work on motor vehicles during a reasonable number of hours per day and of days per week. This subsection shall not be construed as prohibiting any person who operates or controls a full service retail service station from discontinuing the retail sale of motor fuels at such retail service station, provided that less than 20 per centum of such retail service station's gross revenue derived from the retail sale of motor fuels, petroleum products, and automotive products and from the repair, maintenance, and servicing of motor vehicles is derived from the retail sale of motor fuels, and provided further that such discontinuance of the retail sale of motor fuels shall not authorize any other substantial reduction in repair, maintenance, or other services previously offered. This subsection shall not be construed as prohibiting a full service retail service station from selling motor fuels on a self-service basis, provided that such retail service station continues to sell motor fuels on a non-self-service basis.</text>
      <text>"(d)(1) A petition for exemption shall be filed with the Mayor by both a distributor and a retail dealer ('petitioners'). The Mayor may grant an exemption to the prohibitions contained in subsections (b) and (c) of this section if the petitioners agree in writing that the distributor will perform the following:</text>
      <text>"(A) Structurally alter, modify, or otherwise convert a retail service station, irrespective of the type or magnitude of the alteration, modification, or conversion, including, but not limited to, any alteration, modification, or conversion that has the effect of merely obstructing access to an existing garage, service bay, work area, or similar enclosed area by any motor vehicle that was previously accommodated, into a non-full service facility; or</text>
      <text>"(B) Substantially reduce the number, type, quantity, or quality of repairs, maintenance, and other services including the retail sale of motor fuels, petroleum products, and automotive products; and</text>
      <text>"(C) Certify that a station is experiencing financial hardship; or</text>
      <text>"(D) Certify that there is another retail service station within 1 mile of the station that provides equivalent service facilities; and</text>
      <text>"(E) Certify that the distributor will improve the station in the following ways:</text>

      <text>"(iii) Improve customer conveniences including separate mens and womens restroom facilities, a working air hose for automobile and bicycle tires, and water for windshield cleaning equipment.</text>

      <text>"(e)(1) Within 30 days of the effective date of the Paternity Acknowledgment and Gas Station Advisory Board Re-establishment Emergency Act of 1996, the Mayor shall appoint a Gas Station Advisory Board to make recommendations on petitions for exemptions. The Board shall consist of 5 members: One representing the retail service station dealers, 1 representing the oil companies, 2 representing the consumer interest, and 1 representing the Mayor.</text>
