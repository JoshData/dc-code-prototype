      <text b="True">MAYOR'S STATEMENT</text>
    </text>
    <text>This Administration has for some time recognized that the labor-related programs and services in the District of Columbia have been organizationally scattered and fragmented. In the past, several administrative initiatives were undertaken to unite major labor elements but these efforts were frustrated principally because a major organizational component was by law a Federal agency. This impediment was eliminated with the passage of "The Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act" which specifically provided for the transfer of the D.C. Manpower Administration from the United States Department of Labor to the District of Columbia Government. As a result of this new opportunity, I appointed a select executive Task Force on Labor, chaired by the City Administrator, to recommend to me a design for a District of Columbia Department of Labor with the objective of consolidating in this new Department the responsibilities for the major labor-related programs and services provided by this Government.</text>
    <text>The enclosed Reorganization Plan embodies the results of the Task Force's extensive review of the District's labor-related services, and, thus, represents a practical and measured judgement concerning those activities to be housed in the new Department. It is our strong conviction that this new Department has a unique potential for delivering coordinated labor related services which will enhance our citizens economic security, physical well-being, and productivity as workers as well as the potential for future expansion to include other labor related activities.</text>
    <text>Further, the combination of programs centralized in this new Department will provide a concentration of specialized resources which can be tapped to support and strengthen other major policy initiatives of our Government, such as those in economic development and housing.</text>
    <text>A. SUMMARY OF THE PLAN:</text>
    <text>The Plan consolidates in the proposed Department of Labor the following organizations and/or programs:</text>
    <level>
      <text><text i="True">The Department of Manpower</text> -- all its current services, programs, and responsibilities.</text>
      <text><text i="True">The District Unemployment Compensation Board</text> -- all its current services, programs, and responsibilities.</text>
      <text>From the Minimum Wage and Industrial Safety Board, the Minimum Wage and Industrial Safety Divisions -- all of their current programs and responsibilities.</text>
      <text>From the Office of Budget and Management Systems, the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act Staff and all its services, programs, and responsibilities under Titles II and VI of the Federal Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA).</text>
    </level>
    <text>There are five boards affected by this reorganization: The District Unemployment Compensation Board, the Employment Security Board, the Minimum Wage and Industrial Safety Board, the Apprenticeship Council, and the Manpower Services Planning Advisory Council. Under the proposed Department, an Employment Security Board has been created to replace the District Unemployment Compensation Board and the Employment Security Board. Also in anticipation of an approved D.C. Occupational Safety and Health State Plan, the Minimum Wage and Industrial Safety Board has been abolished and two separate Boards established: the Wage-Hour Board and the Occupational Safety and Health Board.</text>
    <text>At some date subsequent to this reorganization plan, we plan to develop proposed legislation for a locally administered workmens' compensation law. Currently this worker protection is provided through the United States Department of Labor under provisions of the Federal Longshoreman's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, as well as, under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act. Upon passage of a local compensation act, we would expect that its provisions would be administered by the Department proposed by this Plan.</text>
    <text>Organizationally, the Plan presents a Department with three major line operations and two major staff offices. The line elements are:</text>
    <level>
      <text>a. <text i="True">A Bureau of Employment Security</text> -- comprised of the employment services from the Department of Manpower and the unemployment benefit program from the District Unemployment Compensation Board.</text>
      <text>b. <text i="True">An Office of Labor Standards</text> -- comprised of the enforcement activities of the Industrial Safety and Minimum Wage Divisions of the Minimum Wage and Industrial Safety Board. This Office will also have the broad responsibility for developing services and programs to serve workers at their place of work, and will initiate the preliminary activities to establish and operate a District workmens' compensation program.</text>
      <text>c. <text i="True">An Office of Employability Development</text> -- comprised of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act responsibilities now administered by the Department of Manpower and the Office of Budget and Management Services, plus the District's Apprenticeship and Training Staff.</text>
    </level>
    <text>The Staff offices would consist of:</text>
    <level>
      <text>a. <text i="True">An Office of Administration and Management</text> -- which would centralize from each of the previously independent agencies such functions as budgeting, accounting, personnel, management analysis, logistical and contractual services, and statistical research.</text>
      <text>b. <text i="True">An Office of Information Systems and Data Processing</text> -- which would plan, design, implement, and prepare output for all departmental management information and data systems, both manual and automated, including electronic processing of payments to recipients of unemployment insurance and other manpower related monetary benefits.</text>
    </level>
    <text>B. EXPECTED BENEFITS</text>
    <text>In the short run, we would expect to discern the following benefits:</text>
    <level>
      <text>An improvement in labor-related planning, policy development, budget formulation, accountability, management control, coordination and responsiveness in the Executive Branch of the District Government through a reduction in the executive span of control.</text>
      <text>An improvement of service delivery through the organizational linking of the District's State Employment Service with its Unemployment Insurance program to form a traditional Employment Security System with services delivered in approximately seven community job centers.</text>
      <text>Improved coordination of both employment service and unemployment insurance services with all programs administered by the Department under the District's Comprehensive Employment and Training Act program (CETA).</text>
      <text>Improved coordination in planning and administration of programs under the different Titles of the Federal Comprehensive Employment and Training Act through the consolidation of all responsibility in the new Department.</text>
      <text>Improved relationship with the Federal Government by establishing a single point of contact and accountability in the District Government for all major programs funded through and by the U.S. Department of Labor.</text>
      <text>Improved understanding of the functions and trends in the local labor market through the organizational consolidation of units collecting and analyzing various sources of labor information.</text>
      <text>Improved inter-departmental coordination of policy development, planning, and program implementation, especially for manpower/labor and economic development plans of the executive branch.</text>
    </level>
    <text>Over a longer period of time, we would expect that benefits would accrue through:</text>
    <level>
      <text>An improved organizational posture to respond to changes in the economy which impacts on employment and/or unemployment, as well as changes in program delivery strategies resulting from either national or local policy initiatives.</text>
      <text>The development of a more highly integrated service delivery system, especially for the various manpower programs, resulting in more efficient resource utilization and effective service delivery.</text>
      <text>The development of a District managed workmens' compensation program which when operated by the Department in tandem with the occupational safety and health, and unemployment compensation program will provide a significant program for protecting the welfare and economic security of District workers.</text>
