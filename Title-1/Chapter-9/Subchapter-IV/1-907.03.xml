        <text>"(A) When specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the actuary shall determine the level percentage of covered payroll, expressed as a percentage (hereinafter in this chapter referred to as the 'normal contribution rate'), which shall be the percentage which if paid annually into the Funds from the date of the actuarial determination until the date of death, retirement, or other withdrawal from employment for all participants covered by the retirement program and added to (i) all future employee contributions to the Funds, (ii) the assets in the Funds, and (iii) projected future investment earnings of the Funds, are projected to be sufficient to pay for the future benefits payable from the Funds to that group. If deemed appropriate by the Retirement Board, separate normal contribution rates may be determined for different classifications of employees.</text>
        <text>"(B) When specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the enrolled actuary shall determine the current value of the assets in the Funds as of the actuarial determination date.</text>
        <text>"(C) The actuary shall also determine such additional information as the Retirement Board may require to make the determinations specified in paragraph (4) of this subsection and in subsection (b) of this section.</text>
        <text>"(2) Unless the actuary engaged by the Retirement Board pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection determines that a more frequent valuation is necessary to support the actuary's opinion, the actuary shall make the determinations described in paragraph (1)(A) and (B) of this subsection:</text>

        <text>"(D) The value of assets, as determined by the actuary, for use in development of the normal contribution rate.</text>
        <text>"(4) On the basis of the most recent certification submitted by the enrolled actuary under paragraph (3) of this subsection, the Retirement Board shall certify the normal contribution rate applicable for the next fiscal year for each separate fund comprising the Funds.</text>
