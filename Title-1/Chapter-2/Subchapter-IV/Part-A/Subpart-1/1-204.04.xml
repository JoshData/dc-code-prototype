        <text>(d) All measures transmitted for introduction by an entity other than the Council shall be addressed to the Chairman and filed in the Office of the Secretary. The Secretary shall circulate the measure in accordance with these rules.</text>
        <text>403. INTRODUCTION OF EMERGENCY LEGISLATION.</text>
        <text>Emergency legislation and resolutions declaring the existence of emergency circumstances may be introduced as provided in sections 401 and 402 or may be introduced at a meeting called to consider the emergency legislation.</text>
        <text>404. READING INTRODUCTIONS.</text>
        <text>(a) At each legislative meeting of the Council and work session of the Committee of the Whole, during the period designated for introductions, the Secretary shall read the short titles of bills and proposed resolutions which were introduced, pursuant to section 402(a)(2), between the previous reporting period and the Thursday preceding the legislative or Committee of the Whole work session, giving the numbers assigned as provided in section 445, and the committee assignments as provided in section 405.</text>
        <text>(b) Bills and proposed resolutions may not be debated or amended when they are read for introduction, but it is in order for a member to take exception to a committee assignment or to recommend or request that the Chairman make an alternative or additional committee assignment. (c) The formal reading of the Secretary's report as provided in subsection (a) of this section may be waived by unanimous consent.</text>

        <text>(g) No more than one member shall be permitted to speak on each bill or resolution that is introduced; provided, that a member may yield all or a part of his or her time provided by this subsection to another member.</text>
        <text>405. COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENT.</text>
        <text>(a) When a bill or proposed resolution is introduced prior to a legislative meeting or Committee of the Whole work session, the Chairman shall assign it to the appropriate committee or committees according to the standards of germaneness, unless the Council retains the measure. When a bill or proposed resolution is introduced at a legislative meeting or Committee of the Whole work session, the Chairman may provisionally assign the bill to a committee or committees. If the Chairman does not assign the bill or proposed resolution to another committee or committees within 72 hours, the assignment shall be deemed official at the end of the 72-hour period. If the Chairman assigns the bill or proposed resolution to another committee, the new assignment shall not become official until the next regularly scheduled legislative meeting or Committee of the Whole work session. The Chairman may assign a bill or proposed resolution for comments at any time.</text>
        <text>(b)(1) The Chairman may assign a bill or resolution to 2 or more committees for sequential consideration of all or part of the measure, and may assign all or parts of the measure to other committees for comments.</text>
        <text>(2) Where there is a sequential referral, the Chairman may make the referral and specify a time certain by which, once the measure has been voted upon favorably by one committee, the other committees to which the measure has been referred must report the measure. If a committee fails to file a report within the time period specified, the measure shall be deemed discharged from the committee, and the Secretary shall notify the Chairman that the bill or resolution is ready to be agendized for the next scheduled Committee of the Whole meeting. The Committee of the Whole shall consider the bill or resolution as reported out as well as any parts of a measure that have been automatically discharged.</text>
        <text>(c) The Chairman may reassign a bill or resolution from one committee to another committee, except that the reassignment shall not become official until it has been noted at a legislative meeting or Committee of the Whole work session where the reassignment may be appealed in the same manner as any other decision of the Chairman.</text>
        <text>(d) The Chairman's decisions on committee assignments may be appealed in the same manner as other decisions of the Chairman.</text>
        <text>(e) A committee may not consider a bill or proposed resolution until the assignment is deemed official. An assignment is official once members of the Council have had an opportunity to object to the committee assignment at a legislative meeting or Committee of the Whole work session. This subsection shall not apply to matters referred to the Committee of the Whole, if referral to the Committee of the Whole is required by these Rules.</text>
        <text>406. COMMENTS BY EXECUTIVE BRANCH.</text>
        <text>The Executive Branch may comment on any bill or resolution. Unless otherwise required by law, neither the Council nor a committee must wait for Executive Branch comments before considering the measure.</text>
        <text>407. WITHDRAWAL OF LEGISLATION.</text>
        <text>(a) Whenever a rule, regulation, or resolution is proposed for promulgation by an entity other than the Council and is required by law to be approved, disapproved, or reviewed by the Council prior to its taking effect and would take effect automatically by operation of law, the proposal may be withdrawn formally by the proposer prior to final Council action or, if the Council takes no action, prior to any time limit imposed by law. The withdrawal shall render the original proposal a nullity as if it were never proposed. These proposed rules, regulations, and resolutions may be withdrawn only by written request transmitted to the Chairman.</text>
        <text>(b) Whenever a measure is introduced by a member of the Council, it may be withdrawn formally by the introducer at any time before any action has been taken by the Committee to which it has been assigned (i.e., hearing, markup, or vote). The withdrawal shall be in writing and transmitted to the Secretary to the Council for circulation to the members. The withdrawal shall render the original proposal a nullity as if it were never proposed.</text>
        <text>(c) Without objection, a committee chairperson may withdraw, one time only, a measure reported by that committee from Council consideration until the next regularly scheduled meeting.</text>
        <text>(d) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, if a member of the Council withdraws a resolution approving or disapproving a contract or reprogramming after the date the contract or reprogramming would otherwise have been deemed approved, the measure shall be deemed approved on the date the resolution is withdrawn, unless it has been deemed approved prior to that time by operation of law.</text>
        <text>B. COUNCIL APPROVAL.</text>
        <text>411. CONSENT AGENDA.</text>
        <text>The Chairman shall prepare a consent agenda for each legislative meeting which shall include bills and resolutions that the Chairman believes will be adopted by unanimous vote. The consent agenda shall be approved by the Committee of the Whole at its work session immediately preceding the legislative meeting for which the agenda was prepared. Without objection, any member of the Council may amend the committee print of a bill or resolution without removing the bill or resolution from the consent agenda, if the amendment is delivered to the Secretary at or before the Committee of the Whole meeting and circulated at the Committee of the Whole meeting. Any member may strike a bill or proposed resolution from the consent agenda at the Committee of the Whole meeting or at the legislative meeting prior to the vote on the consent agenda. Bills and resolutions removed from the consent agenda shall be considered as provided in section 311, except that the Chairman may first consider items removed from the consent agenda. Prior to the vote on the consent agenda at a legislative meeting, and without objection from any other member, a member may request that a measure printed on the non-consent agenda be moved to the consent agenda. Legislation remaining on the consent agenda shall be approved by the Committee of the Whole and shall be considered at the legislative meeting as provided in section 311. Approval of the consent agenda during the legislative meeting will include the unanimous approval of all matters included in the consent agenda. If a member asks for his or her vote to be recorded on a particular measure, the measure shall not be included on the consent agenda.</text>
        <text>412. EMERGENCY LEGISLATION.</text>
        <text>(a) Where it is proposed that a bill or resolution be passed immediately due to emergency circumstances, the Council may debate the question of the existence of an emergency and then shall vote on whether emergency circumstances exist. If 2/3rds of the members of the Council find that emergency circumstances exist, the Council shall consider the bill on its merits.</text>
        <text>(b) For purposes of this Rule, an "emergency" means a situation that adversely affects the health, safety, welfare, or economic well-being of a person for which legislative relief is deemed appropriate and necessary by the Council, and for which adherence to the ordinary legislative process would result in delay that would adversely affect the person whom the legislation is intended to protect.</text>
        <text>(c) Emergency legislation shall take effect, according to its terms, either immediately or at a specific time. Pursuant to section 412(a) of the Charter, emergency legislation shall be effective law for not more than 90 days.</text>
        <text>413. TEMPORARY LEGISLATION.</text>
        <text>If the Council finds the existence of an emergency and approves an emergency bill under section 412, the Council may, at the same legislative meeting, consider a temporary bill on first reading without committee referral. The temporary bill must be substantially similar to the emergency bill and may remain effective for not more than 225 days.</text>
        <text>414. DISCHARGE.</text>
        <text>The Council, by a vote of 2/3rds of the members present and voting, may discharge a committee from further consideration of a measure that has been assigned to the committee. Upon approval of the discharge motion, the Council shall consider the bill or resolution as if it had been reported from the committee without amendment or modification or reassign the measure to another committee.</text>
        <text>415. VETOED LEGISLATION.</text>
        <text>Whenever an act of the Council is disapproved by the Mayor and returned to the Council pursuant to section 404(e) of the Charter, the disapproved act shall be the property of the full Council. The Chairman may solicit comments or recommendations on the disapproved act from a committee or committees. A member may move for the Council to reenact the disapproved act prior to the 30-day Council review period provided in section 404(e) of the Charter.</text>

        <text>654. REPRIMAND.</text>
        <text>(a) A reprimand is a formal statement of the Council officially disapproving the conduct of one of its members. A reprimand shall be directed to a particular member of the Council based on a particular action or set of actions that is determined to be in violation of the Council's Rules, law, or policy, but is considered to be not sufficiently serious to require censure. A reprimand is distinguished from censure in that it is not punishment or discipline and, therefore, does not require an investigation or hearing.</text>
        <text>(b) The Council may adopt a resolution of reprimand in the same manner as provided for the adoption of any resolution; provided, that the Councilmember who is the subject of the resolution is permitted to speak in his or her defense prior to action on the motion for adoption of the resolution. The fact that the Councilmember who is the subject of a reprimand does not choose to respond to the resolution or does not attend the meeting at which the resolution is to be adopted shall not prevent the Council from adopting the resolution; provided, that the Councilmember had actual notice of the inclusion of the resolution on the agenda and had a reasonable opportunity to attend the meeting.</text>
        <text>655. CENSURE.</text>
        <text>(a) Censure is a formal statement of the Council officially disciplining one of its members. It is a punitive action, which serves as a penalty imposed for wrongdoing, but it carries no fine or suspension of the rights of the member as an elected official. Censure should be used for cases in which the Council determines that the violation of law or policy is a serious offense. To protect the overriding principle of freedom of speech, the Council shall not impose censure on any member for the exercise of his or her First Amendment right, no matter how distasteful the expression of that right was to the Council and the District. Nothing in this rule shall be construed to prohibit the Council, as a body, from condemning and expressing its strong disapprobation.</text>
        <text>(b)(1) The Council, by a 2/3rd vote, of its members present and voting, may adopt a resolution of censure if it finds, based on substantial evidence, that a Councilmember took an action that amounts to a gross failure to meet the highest standards of personal and professional conduct.</text>
        <text>(2) Substantial evidence is proof that a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion or decision in favor of censure.</text>
        <text>656. EXPULSION.</text>
        <text>(a) Expulsion is the most severe punitive action, serving as a penalty imposed for egregious wrongdoing. Expulsion results in the removal of the member. Expulsion should be used for cases in which the Council determines that the violation of law is of the most serious nature, including those violations that substantially threaten the public trust. To protect the exercise of official councilmember duties and the overriding principle of freedom of speech, the Council shall not impose expulsion on any member for the exercise of his or her First Amendment right, no matter how distasteful the expression of that right was to the Council and the District, or in the official exercise of his or her office.</text>
        <text>(b)(1) The Council, by a 5/6 vote of its members, may adopt a resolution of expulsion if it finds, based on substantial evidence, that a Councilmember took an action that amounts to a gross failure to meet the highest standards of personal and professional conduct.</text>
        <text>(2) Substantial evidence is proof that a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion or decision in favor of expulsion.</text>
