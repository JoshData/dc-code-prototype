      <text>Temporary legislation: Pursuant to (a), the Council often adopts temporary legislation in conjunction with emergency legislation which takes effect after a period of Congressional review following approval by the Mayor (or in the event of veto by the Mayor, action by the Council of the District of Columbia to override the veto), as provided in § 1-206.02(c). Such legislation carries an expiration provision limiting its application, usually, to 225 days. Amendatory temporary legislation is treated under the code section affected; following this, it is listed in the D.C. Laws Not Codified table found in the Tables Volume.</text>
      <text>Emergency legislation: Pursuant to (a), the Council adopts emergency legislation which takes effect upon its enactment (approval by the Mayor, or in the event of veto by the Mayor, override of the veto by the Council) and which remain in effect for no longer than 90 days. Amendatory emergency acts are treated under the Code section affected; otherwise the act is listed in the Emergency Act Table found in the Tables Volume.</text>
