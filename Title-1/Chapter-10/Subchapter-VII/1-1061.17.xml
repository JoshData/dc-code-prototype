    <text>If a voter's mistake or omission in the completion of a document under this subchapter does not prevent determining whether a covered voter is eligible to vote, the mistake or omission shall not invalidate the document. Failure to satisfy a nonsubstantive requirement, such as using paper or envelopes of a specified size or weight, shall not invalidate a document submitted under this subchapter. In a write-in ballot authorized by this subchapter or in a vote for a write-in candidate on a regular ballot, if the intention of the voter is discernable under the District's uniform definition of what constitutes a vote, an abbreviation, misspelling, or other minor variation in the form of the name of a candidate or a political party shall be accepted as a valid vote.</text>
