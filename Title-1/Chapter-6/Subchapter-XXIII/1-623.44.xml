        <text>D.C. Law 14-28 deleted the second sentence which had read: " The rules and regulations shall provide for an Employees' Compensation Appeals Board of 3 individuals designated or appointed by the Mayor with authority to hear and, subject to applicable law and the rules and regulations of the Mayor, make final administrative decisions on appeals taken from determinations and awards with respect to claims of employees."</text>
        <text>D.C. Law 15-290 rewrote the section which had read:</text>

The Mayor may determine the nature and extent of the proof and evidence required to establish the right to benefits under this subchapter without regard to the date of injury or death for which claim is made."</text>
