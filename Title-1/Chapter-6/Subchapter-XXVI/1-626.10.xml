Prior to amendment, subsec. (b) read as follows:</text>
        <text>"(b) The District's contributions to the defined contribution plan under § 1- 626.05(3) and the earnings on the District's contributions shall vest when an employee completes 5 years of creditable service with the District, dies, or becomes entitled to disability benefits under the Social Security Act."</text>
