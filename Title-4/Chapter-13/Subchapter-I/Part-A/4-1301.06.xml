        <text>"(a) The primary responsibility for the initial investigation is with the police in cases of an allegedly abused child and with the Agency in other cases of an allegedly neglected child: Provided, however, that the investigation of a report involving acts or omissions of either the Agency or the police shall be conducted by the department which is not involved.</text>
        <text>"(b) The purpose of the initial investigation shall be to determine:</text>
        <text>"(1) The nature, extent, and cause of the abuse or neglect;</text>
        <text>"(2) The identity of the person responsible for the abuse or neglect;</text>
