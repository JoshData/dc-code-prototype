      <text>"(C) All sources of local, federal, and private funding for each program; and</text>
      <text>"(D) A determination of whether each program's services are evaluated for effectiveness; and</text>

      <text>"(A) Meeting, or failing to meet, the primary prevention needs of the District;</text>
      <text>"(B) Meeting, or failing to meet, the secondary prevention needs of the District; and</text>
      <text>"(C) Duplicating services identified in the inventory.</text>
