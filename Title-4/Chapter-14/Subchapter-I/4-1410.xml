        <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
        <text>D.C. Law 18-230 rewrote the section, which had read as follows:</text>
        <text>"Neither the Mayor nor any child-placing agency authorized to perform services in connection with placing a child in a family home for adoption may make or receive any charge or compensation whatsoever for such services, except that a licensed child-placing agency which is organized and operated exclusively for religious or charitable purposes and no part of the net earnings of which can inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual may be allowed to charge adoptive parents, within prescribed limits, for such services an amount not to exceed the average costs incurred; such average costs and prescribed limits to be determined in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the committee created by § 4-1403. Inability of adoptive applicants to pay for all or any part of such costs shall not be a disqualifying factor in determining whether applicants are suitable parents for the child."</text>
        <text>D.C. Law 19-171, in subsec. (b)(1), validated a previously made technical correction in the designation of subpar. (E).</text>
