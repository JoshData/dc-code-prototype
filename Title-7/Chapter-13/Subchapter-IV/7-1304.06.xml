  <text>Except as provided in § 7-1304.06a, hearings shall be conducted in as informal a manner as may be consistent with orderly procedure. Individuals whose admission has been questioned or respondents have the right to be present during hearings and to testify, but shall not be compelled to testify, and shall be so advised by the Court. They shall have the right to call witnesses and present evidence, and to cross-examine opposing witnesses. The presence of the respondent may be waived only if the Court finds that the respondent has knowingly and voluntarily waived his or her right to be present, or if the Court determines that the respondent is unable to be present by virtue of his or her physical disability.</text>
