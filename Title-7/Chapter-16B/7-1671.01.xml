        <heading>Miscellaneous Notes</heading>
        <text>History of D.C. Law 13-315.</text>
        <text>Initiative 59, permitting the use of marijuana for medical treatment, was certified as a proper subject for an initiative by the District of Columbia Board of Elections and Ethics on September 17, 1998. In reaction to the certification, Congress enacted and the President signed the "Barr Amendment" that prohibited the use of appropriated funds to conduct any ballot initiative which sought to legalize or otherwise reduce penalties associated with a controlled substance. Since, the ballots for the November 3 election had already been printed before enactment of the Barr Amendment, District voters still considered the initiative.</text>
        <text>After the vote, the Board of Elections and Ethics refused, in light of the Barr Amendment, to release and certify the results of the vote on Initiative 59. Certain District of Columbia voters then sued the Board.</text>
        <text>In <text i="True">Turner v. District of Columbia Board of Elections and Ethics</text>, 77 F.Supp.2d 25 (D.D.C. 1999), the court ruled that the Board could count and certify the election results concerning Initiative 59. After the count, the Board announced that Initiative 59 had been approved by the voters and certified the results. The initiative was eventually assigned D.C. Act 13-138.</text>
        <text>On October 20, 1999, the District of Columbia Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") submitted a fiscal impact statement that found that implementation of Act 13- 138 would have a fiscal impact and recommended that the cost be included in the development of the fiscal year 2001 budget.</text>
        <text>On October 25, 1999, the District of Columbia Council transmitted D.C. Act 13- 138 to the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority ("Control Board").</text>
        <text>On October 26, 1999, the Control Board informed the Council that it would not accept D.C. Act 13-138 without a revised fiscal impact statement from the CFO.</text>
        <text>On September 30, 2001, the Control Board suspended its activities.</text>
        <text>Between 1998 and 2009 all District of Columbia appropriations acts contained language that prevented Initiative 59 from taking effect as law. Congress did not include the language in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2010 (Pub. L. 111-117).</text>
        <text>With the removal of the "Bar Amendment", the Council transmitted Act 13-138 to Congress on December 21, 2009, for a 30-day period of review.</text>
        <text>Act 13-138 became D.C. Law 13-315 on February 25, 2010, and is published at 57 DCR 3360. D.C. Law 18-210 amended Law 13-315 in its entirety "to read as follows."</text>
