    <text>If at any time the moneys available to the Secretary of Transportation are insufficient to enable him to discharge his responsibilities under guarantees issued by him under § 9-1111.06 or to make payments to the Transit Authority in accordance with § 9-1111.12, he shall issue to the Secretary of the Treasury notes or other obligations in such forms and denominations, bearing such maturities, and subject to such terms and conditions, as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
