        <heading>Miscellaneous Notes</heading>
        <text>Section 3(3) of Law 16-132 required that the fiscal effect of Law 16-132 be included in an approved budget and financial plan in order for Law 16-132 to apply as law. The Budget Director of the Council of the District of Columbia has determined, as of November 2, 2007, that the fiscal effect of Law 16-132 has not been included in an approved budget and financial plan. Therefore, the provisions of this section, enacted by Law 16-98, are not in effect.</text>
        <text>Section 3(b) of D.C. Law 17-360 repealed section 3(3) of D.C. Law 16-132 and restored this section.</text>
