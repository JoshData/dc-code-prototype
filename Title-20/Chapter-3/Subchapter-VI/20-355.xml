  <formerly-cited-as>DC ST 1981 § 20-355</formerly-cited-as>
  <text>The personal representative shall report to the Court immediately, by verified supplemental petition, any property of the decedent discovered after the filing of the petition. If the after-discovered property increases the value of all property of the decedent to an amount greater than the allowable funeral expenses (and there is no family allowance payable) but less than $15,000, the Court shall admit the will, if any, to probate and direct that notice be given in accordance with section 20-353(b). If the after-discovered property increases the value of all property of the decedent to more than $15,000, there shall be no further proceedings under this subchapter, and administration shall proceed under the other provisions of this title.</text>
