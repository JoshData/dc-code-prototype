    <text>On the petition of any interested person, the Court by temporary order and for good cause shown may restrain a supervised personal representative from performing specified acts of administration, disbursement, or distribution, or exercising any powers or discharging any duties of such office, or make any other order to secure proper performance of the supervised personal representative's duty, if it appears to the Court that the supervised personal representative otherwise may take some action which would unreasonably jeopardize the interest of the petitioner. Persons with whom the supervised personal representative may transact business may be made parties.</text>
