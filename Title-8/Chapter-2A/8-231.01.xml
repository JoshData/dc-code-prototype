(4), (29), and (32), substituted "1978," for "March 1, 1978,"; added par. (9A); in par. (13), substituted "or adopted by the Mayor" for "and adopted by the Mayor"; in par. (20), substituted "which shall be adopted" for "and adopted"; rewrote par. (24); in par. (26), substituted "lead-based paint hazards" for "lead hazards" and substituted "to tenants, purchasers, or prospective tenants or purchasers" for "to prospective rental tenants". Prior to amendment, par. (24) read as follows:</text>
        <text>"(24) 'Lead-contaminated dust' means surface dust that contains a mass per area concentration of lead equal to or exceeding 40 micrograms per square foot ('&lt;&lt;mu&gt;&gt;g/ft2 &lt;&lt;SYM&gt;&gt;) on floors or 250 &lt;&lt;mu&gt;&gt;g/ft2 on interior windowsills based on wipe sample, or, for the purpose of clearance examination, 400 &lt;&lt;mu&gt;&gt;g/ft2 on window troughs based on wipe sample, or such more stringent standards as may be specified in federal law or regulations promulgated by EPA or HUD, and adopted by the Mayor by rule."</text>
