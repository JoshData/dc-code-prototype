A request for an order may also be made informally to the court and any individual who knowingly interferes with transmission of the request may be adjudged guilty of contempt of court. A ward seeking termination is entitled to the same rights and procedures as in an original proceeding for appointment of a guardian.</text>

    <text>Upon removal, resignation, or death of the guardian, or if the guardian is determined to be incapacitated, the court may appoint a successor guardian and make any other appropriate order. Before appointing a successor guardian, or ordering that a ward's incapacity has terminated, the court shall follow the same procedures to safeguard the rights of the ward that apply to a petition for appointment of a guardian.</text>
