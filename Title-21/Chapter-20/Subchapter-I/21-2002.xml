      <heading>Editor’s Notes</heading>
      <text>Uniform Law: This section is based upon § 1-103 of the Uniform Guardianship and Protective Proceedings Act (1982 Act).</text>
      <text>Section 21(h)(1) purported to amend (d)(1) by substituting "developmental disability" for "mental retardation"; as that language does not appear in (d)(1), but does appear in (d)(2), LexisNexis believes the legislative intent was to amend that subsection, and has effected the change there.</text>
      <text>Section 35 of D.C. Law 19-169 provided that no provision of the act shall impair any right or obligation existing under law.</text>
