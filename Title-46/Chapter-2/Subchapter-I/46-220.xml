  <heading>Payments by employer where employee has no salary or salary inadequate for services rendered.</heading>
  <text>Where the obligor claims to be rendering services without salary or compensation, or at a salary or compensation so inadequate as to satisfy the Court that the salary or compensation is merely colorable and designed to defraud or impede withholding, the Court may direct the employer to make payments to satisfy the withholding in installments, based upon a reasonable value of the services rendered by the obligor under this employment or upon the obligor's current earnings ability.</text>
