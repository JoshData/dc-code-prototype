        <text>D.C. Law 17-128 rewrote the section which had read as follows:</text>
        <text>"(a) If withholding of both the full amount of current cash support and the full amount of an employee's contributions for health insurance coverage for a child included in a medical support notice or a support order requiring a parent to provide health insurance coverage exceeds the limits of section 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, approved May 29, 1968 (82 Stat. 163; 15 U.S.C. § 1673(b)), then current cash support shall receive priority and shall be withheld in full prior to any withholding being made for employee contributions for health insurance coverage.</text>
        <text>"(b) If the full amount of current cash support and the full amount of employee contributions for health insurance coverage can be withheld within the limits of section 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, approved May 29, 1968 (82 Stat. 163; 15 U.S.C. § 1673 (b)), the employer shall withhold earnings for additional cash amounts that are subject to withholding after the employee's obligations for current cash support and contributions for health insurance coverage are satisfied.</text>
        <text>"(c) If an employer is required to withhold earnings or employee contributions for health insurance coverage pursuant to more than one support order, the employer shall prorate among the support orders subject to withholding the amount of the employee's earnings that are available for withholding within the limits of section 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, approved May 29, 1968 (82 Stat. 163; 15 U.S.C. § 1673(b)), and determine whether the available earnings are sufficient to satisfy current cash support due under all applicable support orders.
