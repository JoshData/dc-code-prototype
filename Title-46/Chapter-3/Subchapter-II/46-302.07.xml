        <text>"(a) If a proceeding is brought under this chapter and only 1 tribunal has issued a child support order, the order of that tribunal controls and must be so recognized.</text>
        <text>"(b) If a proceeding is brought under this chapter, and 2 or more child support orders have been issued by tribunals of the District or another state with regard to the same obligor and child, a tribunal of the District shall apply the following rules in determining which order to recognize for purposes of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction:</text>
        <text>"(1) If only 1 of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter, the order of that tribunal controls and must be so recognized.</text>
        <text>"(2) If more than 1 of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter, an order issued by a tribunal in the current home state of the child controls and must be so recognized, but if an order has not been issued in the current home state of the child, the order most recently issued controls and must be so recognized.</text>
        <text>"(3) If none of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter, the tribunal of the District having jurisdiction over the parties shall issue a child support order, which controls and must be so recognized.</text>
        <text>"(c) If 2 or more child support orders have been issued for the same obligor and child and if the obligor or the individual obligee resides in the District, a party may request a tribunal of the District to determine which order controls and must be so recognized under subsection (b) of this section. The request must be accompanied by a certified copy of every support order in effect. The requesting party shall give notice of the request to each party whose rights may be affected by the determination.</text>
        <text>"(d) The tribunal that issued the controlling order under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section is the tribunal that has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under § 46-302.05.</text>
        <text>"(e) A tribunal of the District which determines by order the identity of the controlling order under subsection (b)(1) or (2) of this section or which issues a new controlling order under subsection (b)(3) of this section shall state in that order the basis upon which the tribunal made its determination.</text>
