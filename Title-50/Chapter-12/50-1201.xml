      <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
      <text>D.C. Law 14-235 rewrote subsec. (i) (redesignated as par. (9)) which had read as follows: "(i) 'Motor vehicle' shall mean all vehicles propelled by internal-combustion engines, electricity, or steam. The term 'motor vehicle' shall not include traction engines, road rollers, vehicles propelled only upon rails or tracks, and battery-operated wheelchairs when operated by a handicapped person at speeds not exceeding 10 miles per hour."</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 15-105, in subsec. (i) (redesignated as par. (9)), validated a previously made technical correction.</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 16-224, in subsec. (i) (redesignated as par. (9)), revived the provisions of D.C. Law 14-235 that expired on October 1, 2005, and substituted "personal mobility devices, as defined by § 50-2201.02(12), or a battery-operated wheelchair when operated by a person with a disability" for "electric personal assistive mobility devices, as defined by § 50-2201.02(12), and battery-operated wheelchairs when operated by a handicapped person at speeds not exceeding 10 miles per hour".</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 16-279, in par. (2), substituted "the Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles" for "the Director of Vehicles and Traffic of the District of Columbia"; and rewrote par. (3), which formerly read:</text>
      <text>"(c) 'Recorder' shall mean the Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia, including assistants or agents duly designated by the Recorder."</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 16-305, in par. (9), purported to substitute "person with a disability" for "handicapped person".</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 17-353 validated a previously made technical correction in par. (6).</text>
      <text>The 2013 amendment by D.C. Law 19-290 rewrote (9).</text>

      <heading>Change in Government</heading>
      <text>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</text>
