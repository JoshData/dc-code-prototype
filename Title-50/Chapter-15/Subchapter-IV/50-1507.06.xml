        <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
        <text>D.C. Law 15-307 rewrote this section which had read:</text>
        <text>"The Mayor shall establish a registration fee schedule for commercial vehicles to carry out the purposes of this subchapter. The fees which this subchapter generates shall be placed in a designated account and used to offset the cost of implementing the provisions of this subchapter."</text>
        <text>D.C. Law 16-33 rewrote subsec. (b), which had read as follows:</text>
        <text>"(b) Vehicle registration fees for IRP registrants, and all interest earned on those fees, shall be deposited into the IRP Fund and shall be used, first, to reimburse IRP member jurisdictions and, second, to offset the costs of implementing this subchapter. The IRP Fund shall be used solely for the purposes set forth in this section. All monies collected under this section and all interest earned on those monies, shall be deposited into the IRP Fund without regard to fiscal year limitation pursuant to an act of Congress. All monies deposited into the Fund shall not revert to the General Fund of the District of Columbia at the end of any fiscal year or at any other time, but shall be continually available for the uses and purposes set forth in this section, subject to authorization by Congress."</text>
        <text>D.C. Law 19-21, in subsec. (b)(2), substituted "shall be deposited into the unrestricted fund balance of the General Fund of the District of Columbia" for "may be used by the Department of Motor Vehicles to defray operating costs"; and rewrote subsec. (b)(3), which formerly read:</text>
        <text>"(3) All monies collected under this subsection and all interest earned on those monies shall be deposited into the IRP Fund without regard to fiscal year limitation, shall not revert to the fund balance of the General Fund at the end of any fiscal year or at any other time, but shall be continually available for the uses and purposes set forth in this subsection, subject to authorization by Congress."</text>
