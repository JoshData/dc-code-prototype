        <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
        <text>D.C. Law 15-307, in subsec. (a), substituted "the name, driver's license number, and address of the person who leased, rented, or otherwise had care, custody, or control of the vehicle; except that if the vehicle was in the temporary care, custody, or control of a business, the owner need only provide the name and address of that business" for "the name and address of the person who leased, rented, or otherwise had care, custody, or control of the vehicle".</text>
        <text>D.C. Law 19-187 rewrote subsec. (a); and, in subsec. (b), substituted "Department of Motor Vehicles" for "Bureau of Motor Vehicle Services". Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) read as follow:</text>
        <text>"(a) The owner of a vehicle issued a notice of infraction shall be liable for payment of the fine assessed for the infraction, unless the owner can furnish evidence that the vehicle was, at the time of the infraction, in the custody, care, or control of another person. In the event that the registered owner claims that the vehicle was in the custody, care, or control of another person, the registered owner of the vehicle shall provide evidence in a sworn affidavit, under penalty of perjury, setting forth the name, driver's license number, and address of the person who leased, rented, or otherwise had care, custody, or control of the vehicle; except that if the vehicle was in the temporary care, custody, or control of a business, the owner need only provide the name and address of that business."</text>
