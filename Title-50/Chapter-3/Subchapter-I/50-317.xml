    <text>Within 12 months of March 25, 1986, and at least once every 24 months thereafter, the Commission's Panel on Rates and Rules shall undertake a review of the taxicab rate structure.

    <text>The panel and the full commission, in the establishment and supervision of the taxicab rate structure, shall balance equitably the interest of owners and operators of taxicabs, taxicab companies and associations, and dispatch services in procuring a maximum rate of return on investment and labor against the public interest in maintaining a taxicab system affordable to a broad cross section of the public, and shall establish nondiscriminatory rates, charges, matrices, boundaries, and methodologies for the determination of taxicab fares which assure reasonable and adequate compensation and promote broad and nondiscriminatory public access to taxicab transportation facilities.</text>

      <text>D.C. Law 19-184, effective October 22, 2012, amended this section subject to the inclusion of its fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan, as certified by the Chief Financial Officer to the Budget Director of the Council in a certification published by the Council in the District of Columbia Register. As of April 1, 2013, this certification has not occurred; therefore the amendment has not been implemented.</text>
