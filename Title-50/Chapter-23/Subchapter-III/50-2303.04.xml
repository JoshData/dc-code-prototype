        <text>"(2) Within 30 days after receiving notice from the Bureau of the date and time of an infraction, as well as other information contained in the original notice of infraction, the lessor submits to the Bureau the correct name and address of the person to whom the vehicle identified in the notice of infraction was rented or leased at the time of the infraction and the lessor notifies such person by mail of the notice of infraction.</text>
        <text>"(c) Where the lessor has paid any fine or penalty for which he is liable and the Bureau thereafter collects from the person to whom the vehicle was rented or leased the amount of the scheduled fine and penalties owed by such person, or any portion thereof, the lessor shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Bureau of the amount of the fines and penalties paid by the lessor, less the Bureau's cost of collection.</text>
