        <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
        <text>D.C. Law 13-289, in subsec. (e), substituted "on its face, for reasons other than compliance with subsection (b)" for "on its face".</text>
        <text>D.C. Law 16-279 rewrote subsec. (c), which formerly read:</text>
        <text>"(c) A notice of infraction shall be served personally upon the operator of a vehicle who is present at the time of service and his name, together with the plate designation and the plate type as shown by the registration plates of said vehicle and the make or model of such vehicle, shall be inserted therein. If the operator is not present, the notice of infraction shall be served upon the owner of the vehicle by affixing such notice to such vehicle in a conspicuous place, by inserting the word "owner" in the space provided for identification of such person and by noting the plate designation and plate type as shown by the registration plates of such vehicle together with the make or model of such vehicle. Service of the notice of infraction or a duplicate thereof by affixation, as herein provided, shall have the same force and effect and shall be subject to the same penalties for the disregard thereof as though the notice of infraction was personally served on the owner and operator of the vehicle."</text>
        <text>D.C. Law 17-217 rewrote subsec. (c) and added subsecs. (c-1) and (c-2). Prior to amendment, subsec. (c) read as follows:</text>
        <text>"(c) A notice of infraction shall be served personally upon the operator of a vehicle who is present at the time of service or by affixing such notice to the vehicle in a conspicuous place and by noting the plate designation and plate type as shown by the registration plates of such vehicle together with the make or model of the vehicle. Service of the notice of infraction or a duplicate thereof by affixation shall have the same force and effect, and the infraction shall be subject to the same penalties for the disregard thereof as though the notice of infraction was personally served on the owner and operator of the vehicle."</text>
