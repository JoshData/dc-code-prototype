        <text>"(b) During the term of a performance parking pilot zone, DDOT, in collaboration with the Ward councilmember, shall conduct quarterly public meetings to provide an update on all parking management targets within the zone and an opportunity for public comment on the program.</text>
        <text>"(c) If a performance parking pilot zone is not meeting established parking management targets after the 2nd quarter of operation, DDOT shall re-evaluate the strategies used and implement a revised plan. Within 30 days after the 2nd quarter of operation, any revised plan shall be implemented and transmitted to the Council and ANCs, pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</text>
        <text>"(d) The Mayor shall submit an annual report for the prior fiscal year on each performance parking pilot zone.

At a minimum, the report shall include:</text>
