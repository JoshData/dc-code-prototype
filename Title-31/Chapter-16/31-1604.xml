      <text>A named insured who tests positive under the testing protocol certified by the Commissioner may appeal to the Commissioner of Insurance and Securities to review the testing procedures and results, and may present additional medical evidence, including the results of similar tests for exposure to the probable causative agent of AIDS that the named insured independently obtains, to rebut the positive test results. If the Commissioner of Insurance and Securities determines that the result of the test of the proposed insured is not a true positive, the Commissioner of Insurance and Securities shall order the insurer from which the applicant sought coverage to disregard the positive test result. The Commissioner of Insurance and Securities shall, when necessary, request the advice of the Commissioner in making this determination.</text>
