        <text>The "operative date of § 31-4705.02," referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, was prescribed by § 2 of the Act of October 13, 1962, 76 Stat. 712, Pub. L. 87-738, which was formerly codified as § 35-507(g) [1981 Ed.]. Section 35-507 [§ 31-4705.02, 2001 Ed.] was rewritten effective March 14, 1985, and no longer contains the "operative date" language.</text>
