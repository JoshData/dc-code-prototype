    <text>If a company amends its articles of incorporation by providing for an increase of its capital stock, such increase shall be subscribed and fully paid up within 1 year of the date of such amendment, unless the Commissioner shall certify his consent to an extension of such time. Failure to have such increase of capital stock paid up within the time provided may be considered grounds for ousting the company from its powers under any such amendment to such articles of incorporation by a court of competent jurisdiction in a proceeding by the Commissioner, the Corporation Counsel representing him, against the company for such judgment.</text>
