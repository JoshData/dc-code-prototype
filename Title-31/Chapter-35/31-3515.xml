Upon consummation of the plan, the resulting stock insurance company shall fully comply with the requirements of Subdivision A of Subtitle VI of this title as set forth in subsection (b)(2) of this section. For the purpose of such conversion, the owners of the corporation shall be contractholders and surplus note holders, if there are any surplus notes.</text>
        <text>"(b) The Mayor shall approve any proposed plan or procedure for conversion to a for-profit insurance company not involving a nonprofit hospital service plan or medical service plan unless the Mayor finds that the plan or procedure:</text>
        <text>"(1) Is inequitable to contractholders of the converting corporation or to the public;</text>
        <text>"(2) Fails to comply with §§ 31-4405, 31-4410 through 31-4415, 31-4421, 31- 4424, 31-4428, and 31-4431, and Chapter 13A of this title.</text>
        <text>"(3) Provides that any part of the assets or surplus of the corporation will inure directly or indirectly to any officer, director, or trustee of the corporation; or</text>
        <text>"(4) Does not ensure that the resulting stock insurance company will possess capital and surplus in an amount sufficient to:</text>
        <text>"(A) Comply with the capital and stock surplus requirements for a stock life insurance company under § 31-4409; and</text>
        <text>"(B) Provide for the security of the resulting stock insurance company's contractholders.</text>
        <text>"(b-1) In a conversion of a nonprofit hospital service plan or medical service plan to a for-profit insurance company under this section, the acquiring company shall have the burden of establishing that the proposed conversion does not result in the existence of any of the conditions set forth in section (b)(1) through (4) of this subsection.</text>
        <text>"(c) Any corporation that becomes a for-profit insurance company under this section shall not be deemed to have abandoned its corporate status by virtue of the conversion, unless the conversion plan expressly provides to the contrary.</text>
        <text>"(d) The certificate of authority, agent appointments, contract forms, and other filings which are in existence at the time of the conversion shall continue in full force and effect upon conversion if the resulting corporation at all times remains qualified to issue subscriber contracts in the District of Columbia.</text>
        <text>"(e) All outstanding subscriber contracts of the converting corporation shall remain in full force and effect and need not otherwise be endorsed unless ordered by the Mayor.</text>
        <text>"(f) A corporation issued a certificate of authority under this chapter that offers an open enrollment program under § 31-3514 may, directly or through a subsidiary, continue to offer such program notwithstanding its conversion to a stock company. However, the premium tax rate imposed on the company shall be in accordance with § 47-2608.</text>
