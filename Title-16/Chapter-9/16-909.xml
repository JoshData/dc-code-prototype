        <text>D.C. Law 13-269 rewrote subsec. (b-1)(1), which formerly read:</text>
        <text>"(1) Upon a genetic test result and an affidavit from a laboratory, certified by the American Association of Blood Banks, indicating a 99% probability that the putative father is the father of the child; or"</text>
        <text>rewrote subsec. (c) which formerly read:</text>
        <text>"(c) Upon the entry of a final judgment determining the parentage of a child by the Superior Court under the provisions of section 16-2341 et seq., section 16- 909(b) or by any other court of competent jurisdiction upon a genetic test result and affidavit as provided in subsection (b-1)(1) of this section, or if the father has acknowledged paternity as provided in section 16-909.01(a), the parent-child relationship is conclusively established. A parent-child relationship that has been established pursuant to subsection (b-1)(1) of this section or section 16-909.01(a)(1) may be challenged upon the same grounds and through the same procedures as are applicable to a final judgment of the Superior Court."</text>
        <text>and added subsec. (c-1).</text>
        <text>D.C. Law 18-33 rewrote the section, which had read as follows:</text>
        <text>"(a) A child's relationship to its mother is established by its birth to her. A child's relationship to its father is established by proving by a preponderance of evidence that he is the father, and there shall be a presumption that he is the father:</text>
        <text>"(1) if he and the child's mother are or have been married and the child is born during the marriage, or within 300 days after the termination of marital cohabitation by reason of death, annulment, divorce, or separation ordered by a court; or</text>

        <text>"(3) if, after the child's birth, he and the child's mother marry or attempt to marry, (with the attempt involving some form of marriage ceremony that has been performed in apparent compliance with law), though such attempted marriage is or might be declared void for any reason, and he has acknowledged the child to be his; or</text>
        <text>"(4) if the putative father has acknowledged paternity in writing.</text>
        <text>"(b) If questioned, a presumption created by section 16-909(a)(1) through (4) may be overcome upon proof by clear and convincing evidence that the presumed father is not the child's father. The Superior Court shall try the question of paternity and shall determine whether the presumed father is or is not the father of the child.</text>
        <text>"(b-1) A conclusive presumption of paternity shall be created:</text>
        <text>"(1) Upon a result and an affidavit from a laboratory of a genetic test of a type generally acknowledged as reliable by accreditation bodies designated by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that is performed by a laboratory approved by such a body indicating a 99% probability that the putative father is the father of the child; or</text>
        <text>"(2) If the father has acknowledged paternity in writing as provided in section 16-909.01(a)(1).</text>
        <text>"(c) The parent-child relationship shall be conclusively established:</text>
        <text>"(1) Upon a determination of the parentage of a child by the following:</text>
        <text>"(A) The Superior Court of the District of Columbia under the provisions of subchapter II of Chapter 23 of this title or subsection (b) of this section;</text>

        <text>"(3) By a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity in another state pursuant to the laws and procedures of that state, unless either signatory rescinds the acknowledgment pursuant to the laws and procedures of that state.</text>
        <text>"(c-1) A parent-child relationship that has been established pursuant to subsection (b-1)(1)of this section may be challenged upon the same grounds and through the same procedures as are applicable to a final judgment of the Superior Court. A parent-child relationship that has been established pursuant to subsection (b-1)(2) of this section or section 16-909.01(a)(1) may be challenged in the Superior Court after the rescission period provided by section 16-909.01(a-1) through the same procedures as are applicable to a final judgment of the Superior Court, but only on the basis of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact, with the burden of proof upon the challenging party.

        <text>"(d) The parent-child relationship between an adoptive parent and a child may be established conclusively by proof of adoption."</text>
        <text>D.C. Law 18-88 rewrote subsec. (a-1)(2); and, in subsec. (e)(2), inserted "A donor of semen to a person for artificial insemination, other than the donor's spouse or domestic partner, is not a parent of a child thereby conceived unless the donor and the person agree in writing that said donor shall be a parent.". Prior to amendment, subsec. (a-1)(2) read as follows:</text>
        <text>"(2) For a child born to a mother in a domestic partnership, there shall be a presumption that the female domestic partner of the child's mother is a parent of the child if the mother and the mother's domestic partner are or have been in a domestic partnership at the time of either conception or birth, or between conception and birth, and the child is born during the domestic partnership, or within 300 days after the termination of the domestic partnership pursuant to § 32-702(d)."</text>
