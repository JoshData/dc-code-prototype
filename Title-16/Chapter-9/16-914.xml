        <text>D.C. Law 13-91, in subpar. (a)(3)(P), substituted "or Program on Work" for "Program on Work".</text>
        <text>D.C. Law 14-207, in the section heading, substituted "Custody of children." for "Retention of jurisdiction as to alimony and custody of children."; in subsec. (a), rewrote par (1), and in par. (3), substituted "a child" for "infant children" and in subpar. (K) of par. (3), deleted "or children's"; repealed subsec. (a-2); and added subsecs.

        <text>"(a)(1) After the issuance of a decree of divorce granting alimony and providing for the care and custody of children, the case shall still be considered open for any future orders relating to those matters.

        <text>"(a-2) The mere enactment of the Joint Custody of Children Act of 1996 does not, in and of itself, constitute a substantial and material change in circumstances and, therefore, may not constitute the sole basis for modifying or terminating a custody award."</text>
