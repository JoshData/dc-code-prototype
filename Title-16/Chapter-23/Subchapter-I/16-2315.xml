      <text>The Division may order a child admitted as an inpatient to a suitable medical facility for the purpose of a mental health examination only after a psychiatrist or qualified psychologist examines the child and makes a written finding that the child is in need of a mental health examination which cannot be effectively provided on an outpatient basis. The written finding of the psychiatrist or qualified psychologist shall be a part of the Division's order. These procedures for the inpatient mental health examination of a child shall not apply if the child is subject to the emergency hospitalization provisions of section 21-521.</text>

If prior to the time the child reaches the age of 21 it appears that he will not regain his competency to participate in the proceedings, the Corporation Counsel shall initiate commitment proceedings pursuant to Chapter 5 of Title 21.</text>
        <text>"(3) If, as a result of mental examination, the Division determines that a child alleged to be in need of supervision is incompetent to participate in proceedings under the petition by reason of mental illness or at least moderate mental retardation as defined in section 7-1301.03(2), it shall suspend further proceedings.
