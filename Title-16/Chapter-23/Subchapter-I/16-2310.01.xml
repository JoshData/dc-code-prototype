  <text>The Director of the Department of Human Services and the Director of Social Services shall ensure that each child at risk who is detained, however briefly, pursuant to section 16-2311(a)(2) or (b)(1) shall be physically separated at all times, except during transportation, from children or other detainees 13 years of age or older, from any child under the age of 13 who has been detained on the ground that there is probable cause to believe the child has committed a crime of violence, as defined in section 23-1331(4), or in any other manner deemed to ensure the safety of the child. Neither the Department of Human Services nor the Director of Social Services shall deliver a child under the age of 13 to the custody of the United States Marshals Service. For the purposes of this section, "child at risk" means a child under the age of 13 or any child 13 years of age or older who, because of his or her size or physical stature, is determined to be especially physically or psychologically vulnerable to attacks by other children.</text>
