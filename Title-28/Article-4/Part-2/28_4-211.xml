      <heading>UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE COMMENT</heading>
      <text>The section completes the thought of the previous section and makes clear that a security interest in an item is "value" for the purpose of determining the holder's status as a holder in due course. The provision is in accord with the prior law (N.I.L. Section 27) and with Article 3 (Section 3-303). The section does not prescribe a security interest under Section 4-210 as a test of "value" generally because the meaning of "value" under other Articles is adequately defined in Section 1-201.</text>
