  <level>
    <num>(a)</num>
    <text>For the purposes of this section the term "overissue" means the issue of securities in excess of the amount the issuer has corporate power to issue, but an overissue does not occur if appropriate action has cured the overissue.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>(b)</num>
    <text>Except as otherwise provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, the provisions of this article which validate a security or compel its issue or reissue do not apply to the extent that validation, issue, or reissue would result in overissue.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>(c)</num>
    <text>If an identical security not constituting an overissue is reasonably available for purchase, a person entitled to issue or validation may compel the issuer to purchase the security and deliver it if certificated or register its transfer if uncertificated, against surrender of any security certificate the person holds.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>(d)</num>
    <text>If a security is not reasonably available for purchase, a person entitled to issue or validation may recover from the issuer the price the person or the last purchaser for value paid for it with interest from the date of the person's demand.</text>

      <heading>UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE COMMENT</heading>
      <text>1. Deeply embedded in corporation law is the conception that "corporate power" to issue securities stems from the statute, either general or special, under which the corporation is organized. Corporation codes universally require that the charter or articles of incorporation state, at least as to capital shares, maximum limits in terms of number of shares or total dollar capital. Historically, special incorporation statutes are similarly drawn and sometimes similarly limit the face amount of authorized debt securities. The theory is that issue of securities in excess of the authorized amounts is prohibited. See, for example, <text i="True">McWilliams v. Geddes &amp; Moss Undertaking Co.</text>, 169 So. 894 (1936, La.); <text i="True">Crawford v. Twin City Oil Co.</text>, 216 Ala. 216, 113 So. 61 (1927); <text i="True">New York and New Haven R.R. Co. v. Schuyler</text>, 34 N.Y. 30 (1865). This conception persists despite modern corporation codes under which, by action of directors and stockholders, additional shares can be authorized by charter amendment and thereafter issued. This section does not give a person entitled to validation, issue, or reissue of a security, the right to compel amendment of the charter to authorize additional shares. Therefore, in a case where issue of an additional security would require charter amendment, the plaintiff is limited to the two alternate remedies set forth in subsections (c) and (d). The last clause of subsection (a), which is added in Revised Article 8, does, however, recognize that under modern conditions, overissue may be a relatively minor technical problem that can be cured by appropriate action under governing corporate law.</text>
      <text>2. Where an identical security is reasonably available for purchase, whether because traded on an organized market, or because one or more security owners may be willing to sell at a not unreasonable price, the issuer, although unable to issue additional shares, will be able to purchase them and may be compelled to follow that procedure. <text i="True">West v. Tintic Standard Mining Co.</text>, 71 Utah 158, 263 P. 490 (1928).</text>
      <text>3. The right to recover damages from an issuer who has permitted an overissue to occur is well settled. <text i="True">New York and New Haven R.R. Co. v. Schuyler</text>, 34 N.Y. 30 (1865). The measure of such damages, however, has been open to question, some courts basing them upon the value of stock at the time registration is refused; some upon the value at the time of trial; and some upon the highest value between the time of refusal and the time of trial. <text i="True">Allen v. South Boston Railroad</text>, 150 Mass. 200, 22 N.E. 917, 5 L.R.A. 716, 15 Am.St.Rep. 185 (1889); <text i="True">Commercial Bank v. Kortright,</text> 22 Wend. (N.Y.) 348 (1839). The purchase price of the security to the last purchaser who gave value for it is here adopted as being the fairest means of reducing the possibility of speculation by the purchaser. Interest may be recovered as the best available measure of compensation for delay.</text>
