  <heading>Financing statements covering consigned or leased goods.</heading>
  <text>A consignor or lessor of goods may file a financing statement using the terms "consignor," "consignee," "lessor," "lessee," or the like instead of the terms specified in section 28:9-402. The provisions of this part shall apply as appropriate to such a financing statement but its filing shall not of itself be a factor in determining whether or not the consignment or lease is intended as security (section 28:1-201 (37)). However, if it is determined for other reason that the consignment or lease is so intended, a security interest of the consignor or lessor which attaches to the consigned or leased goods is perfected by such filing.</text>
