      <heading>UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE COMMENT</heading>
      <text>1. Under former Section 3-102(1)(a) "issue" was defined as the first delivery to a "holder or a remitter" but the term "remitter" was neither defined nor otherwise used. In revised Article 3, Section 3-105(a) defines "issue" more broadly to include the first delivery to anyone by the drawer or maker for the purpose of giving rights to anyone on the instrument. "Delivery" with respect to instruments is defined in Section 1-201(14) as meaning "voluntary transfer of possession."</text>
      <text>2. Subsection (b) continues the rule that nonissuance, conditional issuance or issuance for a special purpose is a defense of the maker or drawer of an instrument. Thus, the defense can be asserted against a person other than a holder in due course. The same rule applies to nonissuance of an incomplete instrument later completed.</text>
      <text>3. Subsection (c) defines "issuer" to include the signer of an unissued instrument for convenience of reference in the statute.</text>
