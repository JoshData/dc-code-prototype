      <heading>UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE COMMENT</heading>
      <text>The definition of instrument in Section 3-104 requires that the promise or order be payable in "money." That term is defined in Section 1-201(24) and is not limited to United States dollars. Section 3-107 states that an instrument payable in foreign money may be paid in dollars if the instrument does not prohibit it. It also states a conversion rate which applies in the absence of a different conversion rate stated in the instrument. The reference in former Section 3-107(1) to instruments payable in "currency" or "current funds" has been dropped as superfluous.</text>
